# Overview
Welcome to your hello-world RAG hands-on tutorial.

In this tutorial, we will learn the how a simple RAG is implemented. 

Here's how we will learn
- Jupyter notebook 
- Python program
- Containerise the application
- Run in the minikube

## Pre-requisites

Software:
- Install Python
  - Verify by running `python3 --version`
- Install Libraries
  - `pip install scikit-learn`
  - `pip install flask`
- Install docker
  - Verify by running `docker run hello-world`
- Install minikube
  - Verify by running `minikube start`
As always, Google is your friend to find the installation.

## Good practices:

It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage your project's dependencies and avoid conflicts with other Python projects.

You can create a virtual environment using `python3 -m venv hello-world` (or `python -m venv hello-world` if you're using Python 2).

Activate the virtual using `source hello-world/bin/activate`.

Read the README for each section for tips on executing the scripts. 

Let's go!
