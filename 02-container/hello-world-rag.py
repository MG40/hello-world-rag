# This is a simple Python program that demonstrates how to use a simple RAG-based information retrieval system to generate a response to a query.

# This is a simple variable called "documents" storing information about RAG.
# In a real-world scenario, you would have a larger collection of documents or a database of information to retrieve from.
# Each document is a string containing information about a topic.

documents = [
    "This is a simple document about RAG.", 
    "RAG stands for Retrieval Augmented Generation.", 
    "Hello, world! is a classic programming phrase."
]

# The following code snippet demonstrates how to use a simple RAG-based information retrieval system to generate a response to a query.
# The system uses a TF-IDF vectorizer to convert the documents into numerical vectors and then calculates the cosine similarity between the query and the documents to retrieve the most relevant document.
# The retrieved document is then used as a prompt to generate a response using a language model (e.g., GPT-3).
# In this example, a placeholder response is generated, but in a real-world scenario, you would use a language model API or a local model to generate the response.

from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity

vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer()
document_embeddings = vectorizer.fit_transform(documents)

def retrieve(query):
    query_embedding = vectorizer.transform([query])
    similarities = cosine_similarity(query_embedding, document_embeddings)
    most_similar_doc_index = similarities.argmax()
    return documents[most_similar_doc_index]


# The `retrieve` function takes a query as input and calculates the cosine similarity between the query and the documents to retrieve the most relevant document.
# The `generate_response` function uses the retrieved document as a prompt to generate a response using a language model.
# In a real-world scenario, you would replace the placeholder response with an actual response generated by a language model.
# The `query` variable contains the query for which we want to generate a response.
# The `response` variable stores the generated response for the query.

def generate_response(query):
    retrieved_doc = retrieve(query)
    prompt = f"Use the following information to answer the query: {retrieved_doc}\nQuery: {query}\nAnswer:"
    # Here, you would call your language model API or use a local model to generate the response based on the prompt
    response = "RAG stands for Retrieval Augmented Generation." # Replace with actual model call
    return response

query = "What does RAG stand for?"
response = generate_response(query)
print(response)

# This code snippet demonstrates how to create a simple Flask API that responds to POST requests with a JSON payload containing a query.
# The API uses the `generate_response` function to generate a response to the query and returns the response as a JSON object.
# The API listens on port 80 and accepts POST requests to the `/ask` endpoint.
# To run the API, you can execute the Python script, and it will start the Flask server.
# You can then send a POST request to the `/ask` endpoint with a JSON payload containing a query to receive a response.

from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/ask', methods=['POST'])
def ask():
    query = request.json['query']
    response = generate_response(query) 
    return jsonify({'response': response})
